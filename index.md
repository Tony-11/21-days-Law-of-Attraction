## So far:
Journey of life so far has been quite rocky and unconscious. I wasn't fully aware of my surroundings and the didn't fully enjoyed the present moment being the part of the universe. My thoughts were random leading to erratic mood swings, countless depression cycles, bad habits, procrastination, oversleep, in-decisive, anger, frustration for most of the times. Only time I was truly free of my thoughts was when I was on the athletics ground exercising. At that time there was constant drive to excel, to improve, to master certain events, to set an extraordinary example, to prove something to myself.
But I have realized that apart from my over-competitive practice sessions, trying to outperform myself, apart from that physical exercise realm, my thoughts were on average on neutral level. Meaning that I had both positive and negative thoughts about myself in equal amounts. I never felt quite happy and joyful all the time but only in very small intervals. And then I was trapped in the vicious circle of porn. It's a never ending loop like a snake eating it's own tail. I created more and more pain for myself out of misery and depression. For 4 year I have been trying everything in my might, I have tried numerous methods, tricks, counter-traps, and what not. But sooner or later all those have failed. Every time I failed, it was the lowest point, for every next failed attempt I reached the new lowest bottom in the abyss. I have been trying to get out of this hole for so much time. But I never gave up. Every time I gather courage, I found some new method, some new ideology, some new beliefs. But now I have accepted it all that I have to keep trying till I get it figured out. Today morning, I read this book "The Secret" by Rhonda Byrne. Also there are 21 days till I join my Job in October. So I am now starting the Journey to the Universe and realized the Law of Attraction to its full powers. I have already asked, believed and received success in every field form the universe.

## Law of Attraction:
My thoughts are very powerful, they are very important. They are the creative force of the whole universe. I know I have all the power of universe inside me which is all I need to make changes which I want. Whatever I think, my thoughts attract that reality in the actual manifested seen world around me. I have asked the universe of the feeling of love, peace, joy and fulfillment. I believe in the universe, soul, subconscious, God, guardian angel, spirit animal inside me.

## Thoughts map directly to Feelings -
I have

## Time is an illusion:
Time is just an illusion created by the falsely mind. Everything is happen simultaneously, together. All so called past memories, future desires/dreams coexist in the present together in parallel occurring. I believe in my thoughts. The universe inside me receives my thoughts and adjusts to the reality.

## A simple test:
Law of attraction is to plant a seed of thought and having full faith and belief in it that universe will make it happen
